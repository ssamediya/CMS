This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

Building Contact Management System(CMS)

### How do I get set up? ###

Create database manually in the SSMS with the name as "CMS".

1. Run the Database scripts

2. Clone both CMS & CMS-UI on to your machine

3. In CMS project in appsettings.json change the connectionstring "CMSDBConnection" according to your DB connection. You might get error says "An error occured in 'Solution 'CMS' (2 of 2 projects)' while attempting to open 'NuGet - Solution'". But this will not restrict the project to run.

4. Run the CMS project.

5. There is no homepage for web api so it will show "This localhost page canâ€™t be found".

Make sure that node.js is installed in your machine. You can intall it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 


6. Open CMS-UI and run "npm-install" to install node modules

7. In CMS-UI open env.local file and change the api base url as per your CMS project localhost. For exp - LocalHostPath/api/Contact.


8. Make sure CMS is running and then run CMS-UI by using "npm run serve" command

9. Copy the local url from terminal and run in chrome browser.
